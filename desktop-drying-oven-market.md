<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desktop Drying Oven Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Drying</li><li>Air Drying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desktop drying oven market consists of two main types: heat drying and air drying. Heat drying ovens use hot air to evaporate moisture from objects placed inside the oven. They are commonly used for drying delicate items such as laboratory equipment or samples. On the other hand, air drying ovens rely on natural air circulation to remove moisture without the use of heat. This method is often employed when heat can damage the objects being dried or when a gentler drying process is preferred.</p></p>
