<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Sandblasting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity feed Sandblaster</li><li>Pressure Sandblaster</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The industrial sandblasting machine market consists of two main types - gravity feed sandblasters and pressure sandblasters. Gravity feed sandblasters rely on gravity to feed abrasive material into the blasting gun, resulting in a slower but more precise process. On the other hand, pressure sandblasters use compressed air to force the abrasive material through the blasting gun at a higher velocity, allowing for quicker and more efficient sandblasting. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various industrial applications.</p></p>
