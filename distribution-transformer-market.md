<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distribution Transformer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry</li><li>Liquid immersed</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The distribution transformer market can be classified into two types: dry-type transformers and liquid-immersed transformers. Dry-type transformers utilize air or gas for cooling purposes and are typically seen in indoor applications where fire safety is a concern. On the other hand, liquid-immersed transformers use oil or liquid coolant for cooling and are commonly used for outdoor installations. Both types serve the purpose of stepping down electricity voltage for distribution to various locations, but the choice depends on specific requirements and safety considerations.</p></p>
