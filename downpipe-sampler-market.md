<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Downpipe Sampler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Sampler</li><li>Autosampler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Downpipe Sampler market consists of two main types: Manual Sampler and Autosampler. Manual Samplers are operated by individuals who physically collect samples from the downpipe, which requires active labor and attention. In contrast, Autosamplers are automated devices that are capable of automatically collecting samples from the downpipe without human intervention. Both types serve the purpose of extracting representative samples for analysis, but Autosamplers offer greater convenience and efficiency by eliminating the need for manual handling and allowing for continuous sampling.</p></p>
