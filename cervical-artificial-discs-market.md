<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cervical Artificial Discs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal</li><li>Biopolymer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cervical artificial discs market includes two main types: metal and biopolymer. Metal discs are typically made from materials such as titanium or cobalt-chromium alloy and are known for their durability and ability to maintain spinal alignment. On the other hand, biopolymer discs are made from organic materials like polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and offer a more natural feel. They are also designed to promote spinal flexibility and reduce the risk of wear on adjacent discs. Both types aim to replace damaged cervical discs and provide relief from neck pain and discomfort.</p></p>
