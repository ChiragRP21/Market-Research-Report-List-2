<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plough Overturning Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Plough Overturning Valve</li><li>Double Acting Plough Overturning Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plough overturning valves are devices used in agricultural machinery for controlling the raising and lowering of ploughs. There are two main types of plough overturning valves: single acting and double acting. Single acting valves operate in only one direction, allowing either the raising or lowering of the plough. Double acting valves, on the other hand, allow for both the raising and lowering of the plough, providing more flexibility in the ploughing process. Both types are essential components in the agricultural industry.</p></p>
