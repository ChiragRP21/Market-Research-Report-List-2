<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvis Internal Fixation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Locking</li><li>Non-Locking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pelvis Internal Fixation System market comprises two main types, namely Locking and Non-Locking. Locking systems involve the use of screws that securely attach to the bone, allowing enhanced stability and reducing the risk of implant failure. Non-Locking systems, on the other hand, rely on compression of the bone fragments without the use of screws, providing stability through friction. Both types have their advantages, with Locking systems offering stronger fixation and Non-Locking systems providing more flexibility during the healing process.  Overall, the choice depends on individual patient characteristics and the surgeon's preference.</p></p>
