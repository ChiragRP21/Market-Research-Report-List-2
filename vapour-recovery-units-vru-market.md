<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vapour Recovery Units (VRU) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-type Recovery</li><li>Closed-type Recovery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vapour Recovery Units (VRU) are systems used to recover and process volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during storage or transfer of petroleum products. Open-type Recovery VRUs capture and treat VOCs emitted during normal operations, reducing environmental pollution. Closed-type Recovery VRUs, on the other hand, prevent VOC release by fully enclosing the storage or transfer system and recovering the vapours through a closed-loop process. Both types contribute to minimizing VOC emissions, but closed-type VRUs provide a more comprehensive solution by preventing release at the source.</p></p>
