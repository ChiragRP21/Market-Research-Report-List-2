<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CLBO Crystal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated Type</li><li>Uncoated Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CLBO Crystal market offers two main types: coated and uncoated. Coated CLBO crystals have a thin layer of protective coating applied on their surface, providing enhanced durability and resistance to external factors such as moisture and dust. These crystals are ideal for applications that require long-term use or exposure in challenging environments. On the other hand, uncoated CLBO crystals are in their natural state without any additional layer, offering higher optical transparency and efficiency. They are commonly used in applications where optimal optical performance is crucial, such as lasers, frequency conversion, and optical parametric oscillators.</p></p>
