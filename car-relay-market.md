<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Relay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Open</li><li>Normally Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Car relay market types refer to the different configurations of relays used in automobiles. A normally open (NO) relay is one that remains open until energized, allowing current to flow through when activated. This type is commonly used in applications requiring constant power supply. Conversely, a normally closed (NC) relay is closed by default and opens when energized, interrupting the circuit. NC relays are often employed when a system needs to be shut down in response to a specific event. The choice between NO and NC relays depends on the desired functionality in various automotive applications.</p></p>
