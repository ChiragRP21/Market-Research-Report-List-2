<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Slitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat Slitting</li><li>Extrusion Slitting</li><li>Round Slitting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flat slitting, also known as shear slitting, involves cutting a wide roll of material into narrower strips using rotating knives. It is commonly used for paper, plastic films, and metal sheets. Extrusion slitting is a process where a wide web of material is fed through an extrusion die that splits it into several strands. This method is often used for non-woven fabrics and plastic films. Round slitting, also known as razor or crush cutting, employs a circular blade to cut through the material. It is suitable for delicate materials like textiles and thin metal foils.</p></p>
