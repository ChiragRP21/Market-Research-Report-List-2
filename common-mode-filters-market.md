<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Common Mode Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Split Winding</li><li>Bifilar Winding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Common mode filters are used to eliminate electromagnetic interference in electronic circuits. There are two common types of common mode filters available in the market: split winding and bifilar winding. Split winding filters have two separate windings on a single core, which allow for better suppression of common mode noise. Bifilar winding filters have two wires wound together in a parallel and closely spaced manner, providing effective cancellation of common mode noise. Both these types offer different approaches to filtering common mode noise and are chosen based on specific circuit requirements.</p></p>
