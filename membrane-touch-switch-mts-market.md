<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Touch Switch  (MTS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Rubber Dome</li><li>Without Rubber Dome</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Membrane Touch Switch (MTS) is a type of user interface technology used in various electronic devices. The market for MTS can be categorized into two types: with rubber dome and without rubber dome. With rubber dome MTS, a rubber layer is placed beneath the membrane, providing a tactile feedback when pressed. Without rubber dome MTS, on the other hand, lacks the rubber layer, resulting in a flatter surface without tactile feedback. These two market types offer different options to manufacturers based on the desired user experience and device requirements.</p></p>
