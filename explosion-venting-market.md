<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion Venting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flameless Explosion Vents</li><li>Explosion Vents/Panels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Explosion venting is an essential safety measure implemented in industrial facilities to protect against the destructive effects of explosions. There are two main types of explosion vents or panels available in the market. Flameless explosion vents are designed to release excess pressure and effectively suppress flames during an explosion, reducing the risk of secondary fires and minimizing damage. On the other hand, traditional explosion vents/panels are primarily intended to relieve pressure buildup caused by explosions, preventing catastrophic failure of equipment and structures. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of personnel and assets in potentially hazardous environments.</p></p>
