<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile Welding Fume Extractors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatically Cleaned</li><li>Manually Cleaned</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The mobile welding fume extractors market offers two types of extractors: automatically cleaned and manually cleaned. Automatically cleaned extractors are equipped with a self-cleaning function that removes collected fumes and debris automatically. These extractors require minimal maintenance and are suitable for continuous welding operations. On the other hand, manually cleaned extractors need periodic cleaning by the operator. These extractors are more cost-effective and generally used for intermittent welding applications. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining clean and safe air quality in welding environments, but differ in their cleaning mechanisms.</p></p>
