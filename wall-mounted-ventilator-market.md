<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wall-mounted Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-way Flow Type</li><li>Bidirectional Flow Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wall-mounted ventilator market consists of two main types: one-way flow type and bidirectional flow type. The one-way flow type ventilator ensures air is continuously expelled outside without recirculation, making it suitable for areas requiring ventilation but not air purification. On the other hand, the bidirectional flow type ventilator allows both air intake and exhaust, effectively purifying the air by replacing the indoor air with fresh outdoor air. The choice between these two types depends on the specific ventilation needs of the user.</p></p>
