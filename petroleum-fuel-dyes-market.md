<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Petroleum-Fuel Dyes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Petroleum-fuel dyes are colorants used to differentiate various petroleum products, aiding in efficient identification and preventing mixing of incompatible fuels. Powder dyes are finely crushed solid particles, typically mixed with solvents before use. They offer advantages like longer shelf life, ease of transportation, and reduced risk of staining. Liquid dyes, on the other hand, are pre-dissolved or concentrated solutions that can be directly added to fuel. They provide ease of use, better mixing capabilities, and are predominantly used in bulk fuel transportation. Both powder and liquid dyes are extensively utilized in the petroleum-fuel industry.</p></p>
