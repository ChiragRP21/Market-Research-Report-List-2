<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CAR-T Therapy in Haematological Malignancy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Allogeneic</li><li>Autologous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CAR-T therapy is a revolutionary treatment for haematological malignancies like lymphomas and leukemias. Allogeneic CAR-T therapy involves using T-cells from a donor to create the CAR-T cells, which are then infused into the patient's body. In contrast, autologous CAR-T therapy uses the patient's own T-cells, which are genetically modified to produce the CAR-T cells. Both types have their advantages and challenges. Allogeneic CAR-T therapy offers accessibility and scalability, while autologous CAR-T therapy provides personalized treatment and reduces the risk of graft-versus-host disease.</p></p>
