<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elastomer Bellows Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary</li><li>Rotary</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Elastomer bellows mechanical seals are used in various industries for effective sealing applications. They are available in two market types - stationary and rotary. Stationary seals are designed to remain in a fixed position while sealing a rotating shaft, typically used when the pressure inside the system needs to be contained. Rotary seals, on the other hand, rotate along with the shaft they are sealing, making them suitable for applications where the seal needs to move with the shaft while maintaining a tight seal. Both types are crucial for efficient and reliable sealing solutions in different machinery and equipment.</p></p>
