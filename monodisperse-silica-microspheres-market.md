<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monodisperse Silica Microspheres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unmodified Surface</li><li>Surface Modification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Monodisperse silica microspheres refer to tiny spherical particles made of pure silica with a consistent size distribution. The market for these microspheres can be categorized into two types: unmodified surface and surface modification. Unmodified surface microspheres have a pristine surface, without any additional functional groups or coatings. Surface modification microspheres, on the other hand, undergo a process where their surface properties are altered by adding functional groups or coatings, enhancing their compatibility with specific applications. These modifications can include changes in surface charge, hydrophobicity, or the addition of specific chemical groups.</p></p>
