<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solution SBR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Batch s-SBR Process Scheme</li><li>Continuous s-SBR Process Scheme</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Solution SBR (Sequencing Batch Reactor) is an advanced wastewater treatment technology. The Batch s-SBR Process Scheme involves sequential processes such as fill, react, settle, and decant, resulting in intermittent wastewater treatment cycles. This scheme is suitable for treating small to medium-sized wastewater volumes. In contrast, the Continuous s-SBR Process Scheme involves a continuous flow of wastewater, resulting in a more consistent treatment process. This scheme is ideal for large-scale wastewater treatment plants with high flow rates.</p></p>
